### Push
Uploading your local commits (saved snapshots) from your computer to GitHub.

**Think of it like**: Backing up photos from your phone to iCloud. Your photos stay on your phone AND get copied to the cloud.

### Remote
The connection between your local repository and the online version on GitHub.

**Think of it like**: Having your friend's phone number saved. The "remote" is the address that tells git where to find the online version.

### Repository (Repo)
A project folder that git is tracking, containing all your files plus the history of every change.

**Think of it like**: A recipe binder that not only has the current recipes, but also every previous version and who made what changes.
