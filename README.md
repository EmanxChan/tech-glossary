### README
A special file that becomes the front page of your GitHub repository.

**Think of it like**: The cover and introduction of a book - it's the first thing visitors see and tells them what's inside.

### Remote
The connection between your local repository and the online version on GitHub.

**Think of it like**: Having your friend's phone number saved. The "remote" is the address that tells git where to find the online version.

### Push
Uploading your local commits (saved snapshots) from your computer to GitHub.

**Think of it like**: Backing up photos from your phone to iCloud. Your photos stay on your phone AND get copied to the cloud.
